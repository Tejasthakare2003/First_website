        <h2>Shivaji Maharaj</h2>

        <pre id="a">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. Shivaji carved <br>out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha   <br> Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.</pre><br>
        <pre id="b">Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the <br>Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces <br>expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji <br>established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He <br>revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and <br>Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and administration.</pre>
